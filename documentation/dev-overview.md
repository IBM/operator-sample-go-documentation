# Overview

### Description

This section introduces the different ways to deploy and test operators.

* [Run & debug an operataor locally](./dev-run-operator-locally.md).  This allows you to debug your operator in Visual Studio Code.
* [Deploy an operator to a kubernetes cluster without requiring the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) packaging](./dev-run-operators-without-olm.md)
* [Package and deploy an operator using OLM](./dev-run-operator-with-olm.md). This is the approach our script automation uses. OLM packaging is required to advance to sharing an operator via a catalog or marketplace.

You can also learn how to create a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud to test this project.
