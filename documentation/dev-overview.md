# Overview

### Description

Follow these steps to [prepare your workstation and install required cluster components](./dev-prerequisites.md) for developing operators.

Learn the different ways to deploy and test operators.

* [Run & debug an operataor locally](./dev-run-operator-locally.md).  This allows you to debug your operator in Visual Studio Code.
* [Deploy an operator to a kubernetes cluster without requiring the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) packaging](./dev-run-operators-without-olm.md)
* [Package and deploy an operator using OLM](./dev-run-operator-with-olm.md). This is the approach the script automation uses. OLM packaging is required to advance to sharing an operator via a catalog or marketplace.

Create a [Kubernetes](./dev-setup-kubernetes.md) or [OpenShift](./dev-setup-openshift.md) cluster on IBM Cloud to test this project.
