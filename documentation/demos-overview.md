# Demos Overview

This section summarises the key use cases presented in the [20-minute demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6njEyXPieg&t=12m45s).

* [Installing operators with OperatorHub](./demos-operatorhub.md)
* [Automated backup](./demos-database-backup.md)
* [Automated scaling](./demos-auto-scaler.md)

If you wish to perform this demo yourself, [demo setup](./demos-setup.md) instructions are provided, using the provided [scripts](./automation-overview.md) to provision the environment.  Alternatively, your could use the instructions to install the operators [manualy using OLM](./dev-run-operator-with-olm.md).

> Note: the demo use cases have not been tested when the operators are running locally, or deployed without OLM.  These approaches are better suited to development activities.
